 # Task Management (server side)
The server side application for the software engineering design group project.
This project broke into two main programs, a server side application, and a client side application.
 ## A brief Description
The server was created to connect to and manipulate data from several connected clients.  
Client connections were created using the OCSF framework for java.  
Once a connection has been established the user is granted access to manipulate some data in a mySQL database. The connection to which is through the java database connectivity API using a generic username and password.
